1. Some very basic theory.
2. JavaScript Typing & Type Checking
    1. How to do typing in JavaScript
    2. How to do type checking in JS
        1. What we check. JS Types.
        2. When we check. Compile Time vs Run Time.
        3. Why we check. Real-world use case.
3. Live examples
    1. The `typeof` operator
    2. The `null` & `Array` dilema
    3. The is Equal and is Equal Strict case
    4. The `instanceof` operator
    5. The use strict
4. Bonus: Soft TypeScript your app.

# Type system

A programming language should have a type system so that it can work with... data.

[...] Is a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions or modules. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">[1]</a>

Cool.

# 2.1 But how do you "type" JavaScript?

---

## You don't

---

# 2.2 How to do typechecking in JS

---

## You don't

<Steps>

## Or do you?

### By definition JS is dinamically typed meanning that it will try to infer / guess the type of your primitives.

</Steps>

<CodeSurfer theme={nightOwl}>

```cpp
// Dart langunage. Dart is a static typed language

class CarMaker {
  bool isActive;
  int numberOfCarsProduced;
  double lastYearProfit
  String brandName;
  Date dateFounded;
  List<String> models;
  Map<String, CarBlueprint> _privateInvetory;

  CarMaker(this.brandName);
}

// Also types can't be canged.
int variable = 0;
variable = "Hello World!";
// ERROR A value of type 'String' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'int';

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer theme={nightOwl}>

```js

let numberA = 1;
// we assign a number 
let numberB = '1';
// we assign a string

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

<CodeSurfer theme={nightOwl}>

```js

let numberA = 1;
// we assign a number 
let numberB = '1';
// we assign a string

numberA = 'Hello world!'
// ok, no problem
// numberA is now string
// because, well...
// It's holding a String value!

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

Basically JS is dynamic because each time we assign something to a variable, that variable will get the type of that something.



So we’re talking about types. What types do we have in JS?

---

(see session #1. Or serach on MDN.)

Primitives
- `string`
- `number`
- `bigint`
- `boolean`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `symbol`

---

...And Objects.

Like Arrays or Date or Error

---

<CodeSurfer theme={nightOwl}>

```js

class Car {
  constructor(model, maker) {
    this.model = model;
    this.maker = maker;
  }
}
  
class Dacia extends Car {
  constructor(model, maker, isTaxi) {
    super(model, maker);
    this.isTaxi = isTaxi;
  }
}

const Taxi = new Dacia('logan', 'dacia', true);

console.log(Taxi);
// Dacia
// {model: 'logan', maker: 'dacia', isTaxi: true}

```

</CodeSurfer>

---

So we know what we'll need to check. Primitives & Objects.

---

# When do we check types?

- At Compile time (wha.. what?)
- At Run time

---

Js is a dynamically typed scripting language that, in case of modern browsers (all of the modern ones) runs on a JIT (just in time) compiler. [3]

Basically each time you change the code, the compiler *dynamically* checks and changes all variable data types for you.

Note this is my own definition here. Might not be accurate.

---

But you could just force a static type check so that we'll make sure that our variables will always stay the same when we compile our code.

Because we can.

Because TypeScript

(more on TS later)

---

Anyway, in JS, most of the type checking is done at Run time either by us, or by the compiler.

---

# So why do we need to check types?

---

## There are some scenarios where is handy:

1. Would be when we build our own library and we want to make sure we receive what we need.

Imagine we built React.

---

<CodeSurfer theme={nightOwl}>

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

class ReactDOMClass {
  ...

  /** render method mounts the first argument 
    * into the element received
    * at the second parameter
    * @param child ReactNode
    * @param parent Element
    **/
  render(child, parent) {
    // check if parent is a Dom Element.
    // Throw an error describing that parent
    // should be a instance of Element
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

</CodeSurfer>

---

But we ar not building React :(

Instead we are working with Backend teams.

So, 2. We want to make sure that we receive what we need.

Oh...

---

Back to the backend.

GET /invoiceAfterDiscount.

Swagger model:

`{ data, totalWithoutDiscount: 134.54, discountPercent: 34 }`

Actual data:

`{ data, totalWithoutDiscount: 134.54, discountPercent: “34%” }`

---

## Result:

<img src={ssrc} width="900" />

---

### So how do we check our Types?

---

### 1. `typeof` operator

---

<CodeSurfer theme={nightOwl}>

```js
function calculateTotal(totalWithoutDiscount, discount) {
  if (typeof discount !== 'number') {
    console.warn('Discount argument should be number');
    return totalWithoutDiscount;
  }
  ...
}
```

</CodeSurfer>
